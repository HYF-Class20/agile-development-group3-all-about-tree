# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over. these may include:
  - project deadlines
  - UI design or color schemes
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
-->

## Internal: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->
